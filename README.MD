# Introduction
This is a DSL written in Xtext to define general ORM models in a 
platform independent syntax. After you specified your ORM model, the DSL 
generates source code for the programming language and ORM you've 
selected. Because this project is relatively new only a few languages 
and ORMs are supported.

## Currently supported languages
* Python, 3.6.5
* Java 8 (<=) 

## Currently supported ORM
* SQLAlchemy, 1.2.8
* Hiberante, 5.3.1
